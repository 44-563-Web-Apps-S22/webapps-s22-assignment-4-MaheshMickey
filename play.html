        <h3>Tartuffe or The Hypocrite</h3>
        <h4>ACT I <br>SCENE I<br>Madame Pernelle and her servant Flipote, Elmire, Mariane, Dorine, Damis, Cleante</h4>
        <p>Mme. Pernelle.  Let's go, Flipote, let's go.  I hate this place.
            Elmire.  I can't keep up, you rush at such a pace.
            Mme. Pernelle.  Peace, my dear, peace; come no farther.
                    I don't wish to cause you any bother.
            Elmire.  What duty demands, I insist on giving.
                    But, mother, what has caused your hasty leaving?
            Mme. Pernelle.  I just can't stand the way your household runs . . .
                    And no one cares what I wish to have done.
                    Oh, yes, I leave your household quite dissatisfied
                    For all my wise advice has been defied . . .
                    And nobody respects me, and everybody shouts,
                    And truly this is a home for the king of louts!
            Dorine.  If . . .
            Mme. Pernelle.   You, my dearie, are a bold lassy,
                    A little brazen and very sassy,
                    You butt into everything to speak your mind.
            Damis.  But . . .
            Mme. Pernelle.    You, grandson, are a fool of the worst kind.
                    It is I, your grandmother, that pronounce this edict
                    And to my son, your father, I have oft predicted
                    That you'll turn out to be a worthless wastrel,
                    And give him in life a foretaste of Hell.
            Mariane.  I think . . .
            Mme. Pernelle.     My lord, his sister!  You seem so discreet
                    And so untainted, so very sweet,
                    But the stillest waters are filled with scum,
                    And your sly ways earn my revulsion.
            Elmire.  But . . .
            Mme. Pernelle.     Daughter, my views may make you mad,
                    But your conduct in all things is all bad.
                    In your family's eyes you should be an example-setter;
                    In that respect their late mother did far better.
                    You are extravagant, and it wounds me, I guess,
                    To see you sashay about dressed like a princess.
                    A woman who wishes only to please her mate,
                    Dear daughter, need not primp and undulate.
            Cleante.  Madam, after all . . .
            Mme. Pernelle.             And her brother, as for you,
                    I respect you, love you, and revere you, too,
                    But finally, if I were my son, her spouse,
                    I would at once beg you to leave this house.
                    Without cease you teach your rules and mottos
                    Which decent people should never follow.
                    I now speak frankly, but it is my part;
                    I never spare the words that stir my heart.
            Damis.  Your man Tartuffe is satisfied, no fear . . .
            Mme. Pernelle.  He is a holy man whom all should hear,
                    And I cannot bear, without great rue,
                    To hear him mocked by a fool like you.
            Damis.  What?  Am I myself to bear a carping critic,
                    A base usurper with a power tyrannic,
                    Such that we can do nothing for diversion
                    Without hearing about that creep's aversion?
            Dorine.  If we were to hear and obey his whims,
                    We couldn't do anything without sins
                    For he forbids all, this false Capuchin.
            Mme. Pernelle.  And everything he forbids is well forbidden.
                    He strives to guide you on the road to heaven,
                    And it's my son's duty to make you love him.
            Damis.  No, grandma, neither dad nor anyone else
                    Can oblige me to wish for his good health.
                    I'd be false to myself if I didn't say this:
                    When I see him around, I begin to get pissed.
                    I can smell the outcome, and soon this coot,
                    And I will find ourselves in a grand dispute.
            Dorine.  It's certainly a clear cause for remark
                    When a nobody acts like a patriarch,
                    A beggar who was barefoot when he came hence
                    And whose whole wardrobe wasn't worth two cents!
                    And he's gone so far as to forget his past for
                    He opposes everything and plays the master.
            Mme. Pernelle.  Ah! mercy on me!  Things would be better,
                    If you'd only follow his holy orders.
            Dorine.  He passes for a saint in your fantasy,
                    But, I swear, he acts with hypocrisy.
            Mme. Pernelle.  Watch your tongue!
            Dorine.                            Not to him nor his man Laurent
                    Would I trust my honor without good warrant.
            Mme. Pernelle.  I don't know what his servant's like at heart,
                    But for the man himself, I'll guarantee his part.
                    You only treat him with hate and aversion
                    Because he truly strives for your conversion.
                    He hurls his heart up against each sin
                    And the glory of God is all he hopes to win.
            Dorine.  Yes.  But why, especially during some
                    Time past, must he ban all guests from our home?
                    Can a courtesy call offend Heaven
                    Enough to merit a huge commotion?
                    Would you like it explained, just between us? [Gesturing toward Elmire.]
                    Of Madam there, on my oath, he's jealous!
            Mme. Pernelle.  Be quiet, and think before you speak.
                    Others, too, condemn the company you keep.
                    All this bustle from the people who arrive,
                    The carriages ceaselessly parking at curb-side,
                    And the servants in a circle chattering,
                    Make noise that your neighbors find nerve-shattering.
                    I'd like to think there's no harm meant,
                    But when gossips talk, they're malevolent.
            Cleante.  How can you hope to stop people talking?
                    It would truly be most irritating
                    If, for the sake of idle, foolish chatter,
                    We must renounce the friends that really matter.
                    And even if we could resolve to do it,
                    How could you hope to keep the whole world quiet?
                    No castle wall can defend against lies,
                    So let's ignore the fools who criticize,
                    And strive to live in innocence and ease,
                    Letting gossips gossip as they please.
            Dorine.  Daphne, our neighbor, and her petty spouse--
                    Weren't they the ones who slandered this house?
                    Those whom the whole world finds ridiculous
                    Are always first in line to stick it to us.
                    They never fail to sniff out and swiftly share
                    The earliest rumor of a love affair,
                    Sowing seeds of scandal with eager expedition
                    And twisting truth past all recognition.
                    In their own colors, they paint all others,
                    Brazenly calling all men their brothers;
                    In the faint hope of finding some resemblance,
                    They try to give a gloss of innocence
                    To their schemes or to make others share
                    The burden of blame that is only theirs.
            Mme. Pernelle.  All this hair-splitting is off the subject.
                    Orante lives a life that is perfect
                    With all her thoughts on heaven, and I hear
                    That she deeply mourns the way you live here.
            Dorine.  The lady herself is quite an example!
                    You want a chaste life?  She's a nice sample.
                    But old age has stuck her in this zealous mood,
                    And everyone knows she's a reluctant prude.
                    'Cause as long as she could snare a man's heart,
                    She was more than willing to play her part.
                    But now that her eyes have lost their luster,
                    She leaves the world that already left her
                    And uses a pompous veil of phony wisdom
                    To hide the fact that her looks are gone.
                    It's the last resort of the aging flirt,
                    So peeved at having no man at her skirt
                    That, alone and abandoned to solitude,
                    Her only recourse is to become a prude.
                    And these good women censure all with such
                     Great severity; nor do they pardon much.
                    They biliously blame immorality
                    Not from charity, but only from envy
                    That others are drinking in that pleasure
                    From which old age now drains their measure.
            Mme. Pernelle [to Elmire].  Such idle tales form a silly song.
                    In your home, my dear, I've been silenced too long
                    Because, like a crap-shooter with the die,
                    Madame won't give up her turn; but now my
                    Chance has come.  I applaud my son's great wisdom
                    In opening his home to this holy person
                    Who's been heaven-sent to meet your needs
                    In turning from evil to God's holy deeds.
                    For your soul's salvation, please pay attention:
                    What he reprehends, merits reprehension.
                    These visits, these balls, these conversations
                    Are flawless signs of Satanic possession.
                    In them you never hear the holy Credo--
                    Just songs, chatter, gossip, malice, and innuendo.
                    Often the neighbors get stabbed to the heart
                    By vicious lies from the third or fourth part.
                    So good people suffer real anxiety
                    From the sad confusion spread at your party.
                    A slew of slanders are spread along the way
                    And, as a doctor told me the other day,
                    This is truly the Tower of Babylon
                    Because everyone babbles on and on;
                    And, to tell a story that now comes to mind . . .
                    Now look at him and how he laughs!  [Indicating Cleante.]  Go find
                    Some snickering fools. They are just your kind!
                    [To Elmire.]  Adieu, my daughter.  I'll say no more.
                    But I don't intend to darken your door
                    For a long, long time.  You've fallen from grace.
                    [Slapping Flipote.]  Hurry up, there!  Don't stand staring into space!
                    Lord Almighty!  I'll slap your silly face.
                    Go on, you slut, go on.</p>
