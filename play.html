        <h4><p class="direction">ACT I<br>SCENE I<br>Madame Pernelle and her servant Flipote, Elmire, Mariane, Dorine, Damis, Cleante</h4></p>
        <pre>
           <h4><p class="pernelle">Mme. Pernelle</p></h4><p class="speech">Let's go, Flipote, let's go.  I hate this place.</p>
            <h4><p class = "elmire">Elmire</p></h4><p class="speech">I can't keep up, you rush at such a pace.</p>
            <h4><p class="pernelle">Mme.Pernelle</h4></p><p class="speech">Peace, my dear, peace; come no farther.
                    I don't wish to cause you any bothe r.</p>
            <h4><p class = "elmire">Elmire</h4></p><p class ="speech">What duty demands, I insist on giving.
                    But, mother, what has caused your hasty leaving?</p>
            <h4><p class="pernelle">Mme. Pernelle</h4></p><p class="speech">I just can't stand the way your household runs . . .
                    And no one cares what I wish to have done.
                    Oh, yes, I leave your household quite dissatisfied
                    For all my wise advice has been defied . . .
                    And nobody respects me, and everybody shouts,
                    And truly this is a home for the king of louts!</p>
            <h4><p class="dorine">Dorine</h4></p><p class="speech"> If . . .</p>
            <h4><p class="pernelle">Mme. Pernelle</h4></p><p class="speech">You, my dearie, are a bold lassy,
                    A little brazen and very sassy,
                    You butt into everything to speak your mind.</p>
            <h4><p class="damis">Damis</h4></p><p class="speech">But . . .</p>
            <h4><p class="pernelle">Mme. Pernelle</h4></p><p class="speech">You, grandson, are a fool of the worst kind.
                    It is I, your grandmother, that pronounce this edict
                    And to my son, your father, I have oft predicted
                    That you'll turn out to be a worthless wastrel,
                    And give him in life a foretaste of Hell.</p>
            <h4><p class="mariane">Mariane</h4></p><p class="speech">I think . . .</p>
            <h4><p class="pernelle">Mme. Pernelle</h4></p><p class="speech">My lord, his sister!  You seem so discreet
                    And so untainted, so very sweet,
                    But the stillest waters are filled with scum,
                    And your sly ways earn my revulsion.</p>
            <h4><p class = "elmire">Elmire</h4></p><p class="speech">But . . .</p>
            <h4><p class="pernelle">Mme. Pernelle</h4></p><p class="speech">Daughter, my views may make you mad,
                    But your conduct in all things is all bad.
                    In your family's eyes you should be an example-setter;
                    In that respect their late mother did far better.
                    You are extravagant, and it wounds me, I guess,
                    To see you sashay about dressed like a princess.
                    A woman who wishes only to please her mate,
                    Dear daughter, need not primp and undulate.</p>
            <h4><p class="cleante">Cleante</h4></p><p class="speech">Madam, after all . . .</p>
            <h4><p class="pernelle">Mme. Pernelle</h4></p><p class="speech">And her brother, as for you,
                    I respect you, love you, and revere you, too,
                    But finally, if I were my son, her spouse,
                    I would at once beg you to leave this house.
                    Without cease you teach your rules and mottos
                    Which decent people should never follow.
                    I now speak frankly, but it is my part;
                    I never spare the words that stir my heart.</p>
            <h4><p class="damis">Damis</h4></p><p class="speech">Your man Tartuffe is satisfied, no fear . . .</p>
            <h4><p class="pernelle">Mme. Pernelle</h4></p><p class="speech">He is a holy man whom all should hear,
                    And I cannot bear, without great rue,
                    To hear him mocked by a fool like you.</p>
            <h4><p class="damis">Damis</h4></p><p class="speech">What?  Am I myself to bear a carping critic,
                    A base usurper with a power tyrannic,
                    Such that we can do nothing for diversion
                    Without hearing about that creep's aversion?</p>
            <h4><p class="dorine">Dorine</h4></p><p class="speech">If we were to hear and obey his whims,
                    We couldn't do anything without sins
                    For he forbids all, this false Capuchin.</p>
                <h4><p class="pernelle">Mme. Pernelle</h4></p><p class="speech">And everything he forbids is well forbidden.
                    He strives to guide you on the road to heaven,
                    And it's my son's duty to make you love him.</p>
            <h4><p class="damis">Damis</h4></p><p class="speech">No, grandma, neither dad nor anyone else
                    Can oblige me to wish for his good health.
                    I'd be false to myself if I didn't say this:
                    When I see him around, I begin to get pissed.
                    I can smell the outcome, and soon this coot,
                    And I will find ourselves in a grand dispute.</p>
                    <h4><p class="dorine">Dorine</h4></p><p class="speech">Yes.  But why, especially during some
                        Time past, must he ban all guests from our home?
                        Can a courtesy call offend Heaven
                        Enough to merit a huge commotion?
                        Would you like it explained, just between us?<span class="stagedirection">[Gesturing toward Elmire.]</span>
                        Of Madam there, on my oath, he's jealous!</p>
                        <h4><p class="pernelle">Mme.Pernelle</p></h4><span class="stagedirection">[to Elmire]</span><p class="speech">Such idle tales form a silly song.
                        In your home, my dear, I've been silenced too long
                        Because, like a crap-shooter with the die,
                        Madame won't give up her turn; but now my
                        Chance has come.  I applaud my son's great wisdom
                        In opening his home to this holy person
                        Who's been heaven-sent to meet your needs
                        In turning from evil to God's holy deeds.
                        For your soul's salvation, please pay attention:
                        What he reprehends, merits reprehension.
                        These visits, these balls, these conversations
                        Are flawless signs of Satanic possession.
                        In them you never hear the holy Credo--
                        Just songs, chatter, gossip, malice, and innuendo.
                        Often the neighbors get stabbed to the heart
                        By vicious lies from the third or fourth part.
                        So good people suffer real anxiety
                        From the sad confusion spread at your party.
                        A slew of slanders are spread along the way
                        And, as a doctor told me the other day,
                        This is truly the Tower of Babylon
                        Because everyone babbles on and on;
                        And, to tell a story that now comes to mind . . .
                        Now look at him and how he laughs!<span class="stagedirection">[Cleante.]</span>Go find
                        Some snickering fools. They are just your kind!<span class="stagedirection">
                        [To Elmire.]</span> Adieu, my daughter.  I'll say no more.
                        But I don't intend to darken your door
                        For a long, long time.  You've fallen from grace.
                        [Slapping Flipote.]  Hurry up, there!  Don't stand staring into space!
                        Lord Almighty!  I'll slap your silly face.
                        Go on, you slut, go on.</p>
