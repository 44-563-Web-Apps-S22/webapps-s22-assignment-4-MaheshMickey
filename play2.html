            <h4><p class="cleante">Cleante.</p></h4><p class="speech">                         I'm not following;
            I'm sure there'd only be more quarrelling.
            How that old harridan . . .</p>
            <h4><p class="dorine">Dorine.</p></h4><p class="speech">                         Oh, how I regret
            That she can't hear you use that epithet.
            She'd tell you at length what she thinks of your wit,
            And that she's not old enough to merit it.</p>
            <h4><p class="cleante">Cleante.</p></h4><p class="speech">  What a fuss she made about nearly nothing!
            And what a passion for Tartuffe, her darling!</p>
            <h4><p class="dorine">Dorine.</p></h4><p class="speech">  Oh!  Really, she's normal compared to her son,
            And if you could see him, you'd say, "Here's one
            Who's nuts!"  During the war, he seemed quite sage,
            And in serving his prince, showed some courage,
            But now he's become an absolute fool
            Since he gave himself up to Tartuffe's rule.
            He calls him his brother and the love of his life--
            More dear than mother, daughter, son, or wife.
            He's the sole confidant of all his secrets
            And the sole director of all his projects.
            He caresses him, kisses him, and could not show a mistress
            More love and affection than he gives to this
            Leech.  At dinner he gives him the highest place
            And watches with joy as he stuffs his face
            With cakes and tarts and often the best part
            Of a pig, and if he should happen to hiccup or fart,
            Says, "God be with you!"  He's mad about him--
            His honey, his hero.  He always quotes him
            And admires his deeds.  His smallest acts are miracles
            And even his stupidest words are oracles.
            Tartuffe, who uses his dupe to make a buck,
            Knows a hundred wily ways to pluck this duck;
            He rakes off great sums with his biblical bull
            And demands the right to censor us all.
            His foolish footman has such presumption
            That even he dares to give us instruction.
            Madly preaching, he scatters with eyes afire
            Our ribbons, our rouge, and our best attire.
            Last night he ripped up with his own bare hands
            A kerchief left lying in The Holy Lands,
            Claiming our crime was truly gigantic
            In mixing what's holy with what's Satanic.</p>
